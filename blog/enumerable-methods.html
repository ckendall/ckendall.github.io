      Hey, happy New Years everyone! I hope that you all had a fun and safe holiday bringing it all in!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, here we go again!! You know I am actually starting to like writing these blogs. I have never been a writer, but have always enjoyed teaching others how to accomplish something whether it be in math or in the outdoors. This just goes right along with what I love doing, but in blog form! Well this week was all about Ruby and learning how to iterate through Arrays and Hashes. I will be explaining how to use one of the more common methods in Rubyto accomplish this. Let us begin shall we? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data structure that I would like to talk about is the Enumerable map. This structure lets us iterate through a data set. Lets say that we have and array construted like this array = [1,2,3]. We now have a variable "array" with its components of 1, 2, and 3. Say we wanted to multiply every piece of this array by 3 for some reason. We could use map. We would use it like this:

        <p>array.map{|number| number * 3}</p>

      <p>This is telling the computer, okay we are using this "array" variable and are going to run through each and every piece of data in the variable. What's in the curly braces you ask? Well this is what we call a block. blocks take their own variable to not confuse the computer. Number is my 1, 2, and 3 numbers going through it. What happens is it takes the number and then multiplies them by 3.</p>

       <p> This is the process with no variables in the block and we are going through it step by step so you can see what is going on:</p>

        <p>array.map {|1| 1 * 3} then it goes to</p> 
        <p>array.map {|2| 2 * 3} and then finally</p>
        <p>array.map {|3| 3 * 3} this is how the computer runs through it.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end map will return the multiplied result of 
      array = [2, 4, 6], but it doesn't actually change the first variable "array". So the original will still be an array consisting of [1, 2, 3] when called. That may see confusing, but I will explain. Returning and changing/destructive elements are different. When we return an array like this, in map, we are just telling the computer we want the results if we multiply 3 to every number, I don't want to change anything about the original.Now if I added an "!" to my map method like this:

        <p>array.map! {|number| number * 3}</p>

      <p>Destructive or changing of elements with "!" or as most commonly used "bang" we will change the original variable.</p> 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that all this may seem weird, but trust me there are reasons that we want to change our varibles for good or not. That is really all up to the programmer and what the code actually calls for. This is just one way of running through arrays or manuipulating them. There are many, many more and I am still learning them. I don't know if I will ever learn them all, but I will sure as heck try!!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is all for now, I hope you learned a little today! I am actually on a little vaction down in Reno, NV so I am going to go and have a little fun. See you next week!!!
