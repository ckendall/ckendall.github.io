  <h1>Arrays vs hashes</h1>
  <h2 class ="title">Starting DevBootcamp</h2>
  <h3>12-28-15</h3>
    <p>
      Hello everyone,
      Well I am back from a wonderful Christmas vacation full of family and friends and a lot of good food. I hope all of you had a wonderful time with family and friends as well on the extended days off! It was a nice break from work and coding, but now I am back in full swing and ready to get cracking! This week we are learning all about Ruby. I have been studying Ruby for about 6 months now so it will be really nice to get back in it and refreash some brain cells that had been put in the back since I started Dev. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The topic that I would like to discuss today is arrays and hashes. These are very similar in funtioning but differ in how they are written. Let's start with arrays shall we. Arrays are allocated places in memory that we can access via calling there position. positioning in arrays works like this - for spot one we start at 0, spot 2 we go to 1, spot 3 we go to 2, and so and and so forth. Don't worry I will show you because it doesn't make too much sense in words. Here is an example of an array called names <% names = ["Jerry", "Jill", "Cameron", "Penelope"]%> Now, in order to get a certain name from the list we have to tell the computer what one we want by calling the names array and the position like this - <%names[1]%> This will call names and whatever is in the 1 position; in this case it is Jill. Arrays don't only have to hold names how ever they can also hold numbers, symbols - which is efficient way of storing a piece of memory; more on these in hashes, and any other Ruby object we want. That is pretty much the basics on arrays, next up is Hashes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes, like I said, are similar to arrays in the fact that they are able to store data, but they are different in how they store that data and how we access it. Hashes are stored in key, value pairs, so that we know what is where. I read a good way to remember it and that is to think of it as like a fridge. Arrays are assign a numbers to their drawers where as hashes are assigned a name to their drawers. Hashes will have the name - their key, and what's in it - their value. I will give an example of a hash containing names and ages <%names = {"John" => 24, "Jill" => 30, "Ron" => 42}%> So when I want to access one of these I don't have to call names[1] like in arrays I call <%names[John]%> and it will give me the age of John! See they are similar in a way, but different in how we write and store because everything that is in a hash is stored as a symbol instead of a random piece of allocated memory like arrays. I told you I was going to come back to symbols didn't I? Well, symbols are fun little things, they are a good way of storing something that you don't want to take up a lot of space. Lets create a symbol x = :my_str and y = :my_str. x and y will point to the same exact portion of memory while if I created a string x = "my_str" and y = "my_str" these point to differnt instances of that variable. In other words symbols take up a lot less memory than using a lot of variables. Sorry for the long side note on symbols, but I though it was important to know that hashes use symbols and what symbols were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I hope I have explained a little about hashes and arrays and what they actually are. It is the very basics of everything and I can only explain it so well, but there is a lot of information to take in with those paragraphs. Now, its off to get ready for work and all of that fun stuff! 
      See you again in the new year! Hope everyone is safe and have fun!!
