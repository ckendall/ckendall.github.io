  <h1>JavaScript learning</h1>
  <h2 class ="title">Something new everyday</h2>

    <p> 
      Okay, here I am one day after I quit my job...I am feeling a little lost, sad, happy, scared, excited and pretty much everything inbetween. I have lost all security in my life to go to Devbootcamp and I knew this would happen, but now its real, I'm moving to San Francisco in a litle over a week. I have learned so much in such a little amount of time and the learning just continues. I guess lets jump right into all there is about JavaScript that I have learned! I will talk about loops!
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript and Ruby have similar ways to iterate over element in arrays and strings, but I have found Ruby to be a bit easier to do.
      in Ruby I can iterate over element in an array with a simple ".each" method or ".map" or ".collect" they all essentially do the same thing, but just a litttle different. Ruby would look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      array = [1,2,3,4] and call array.map{|num| num * s} and the output would be [2,4,6,8]
    </p> 
    <p>
      now for JavaScript I need to make a for loop like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      var array = [1,2,3,4];
      for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){var newArray = []; newArray.push(array[i]*2); console.log(newArray)}; would output [2],[4],[6],[8]
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of these will iterate through the array and multiply the numbers inside by two but the way that I have to do it in JavaScript is a little bit longer and more complicated, but it allows us to think about the problem more and makes our logic better. I actually really like JavaScript and cant wait to learn more and get better at it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry everyone for the messy blog. I am in the process of figuring out how to fix it because I can now fixate all of my time and energy to this program instead of wasting all of my day at a job! I am glad that I can actually focus on something that I truely enjoy. Wait for the updates they should be good!
