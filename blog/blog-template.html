How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a really good experience. My own experience wasn't all that great by myself, but I got to see what my pair did and what sites he used and it was a lot better. He was able to show me some of his tricks making the wireframe. I also had a really good time writing th HTML page because we were both on the same page. I was driving and he was navigating and all of the code that was being directed at me I could write it real quick. All-in-all I had a really good time pairing on this challenge.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It was extremely helpful because we both had ideas about what the site should look like and in the end we both compromised on the design and I think that it turned out looking good. It helped us develope the page becuase we knew where we wanted everything to go and could write the code on it quickly. 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We decided that having all our our control buttons at top and all of our social media links on bottom made a good wireframe. Also for the blogs, having a link to each blog on the side of the page looked pretty good with the post itself in the middle. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
<hr> I learned that it puts a line across the page. I also learned that when testing the code <table doesn't like being inside of ><h1>.
