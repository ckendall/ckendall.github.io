      Hello again! finally getting settled in and ready to move. I have everything packed up and I will be leaving for San Francisco for a couple days to embark on a new journey in life. We shall see how that goes, but for now lets talk about technology. I have found an interesting topic and would like to share what I have learned about it.
      The topic is the internet.
    <p>
    <p>
      Haven't you always wanted to know how the internet works? I have as well, so I decided to look into a little further. The internet is a fascinating place where all of our computers are connected together. When we send information in the form of data. That data is broken up into pieces where it is imprinted with the destination and goes out into the data space to all be brought back together at the final destination. One article I was reading talked about how the internet could be looked at like the highway system that we have or like mail delivery system. We send out information and it arrives at its place of rest.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is nothing more than a basic computer network. That is why when new applications or sites come along we don't have to shut down the entire network to get it running. We just have to code what we need and let the run through the network. Come to think of it the internet isn't all that magical, it is a place where we are connected and data is passed around. As a child I was fascinated with the inner workings of everything and the internet was just another thing, but finding everything out it's not that wonderous. Don't get me wrong it is a grand invention and I use it everyday, but the innerworkings aren't all to complicated. Sure, if I wanted to dive into it with weeks, months, or longer of research I could probably get pretty deep, but the level of where I'm at, it's pretty simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well the next time I write I will be learning a ton in San Franciso! I hope to see all of you there and having a great time!
