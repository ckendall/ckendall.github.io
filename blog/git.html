    <p>
      Hello all! This is my first blog ever and I am excited and nervous about writing to everyone. Excited because I get to share with everyone my knowledge and energy, but nervous because writing is not my strong suit. Thats okay, this is a journey for us all and lets have some fun!


      Today I am going to touch on a couple subjects here and see if I can explain something in beginner terms to beginners, because I am just learning myself. I wanted to briefly explain version control and what it can do for you. Version control in it's simpliest nature is how one can track changes to their work overtime. That's it! Simple huh?
      <p>
    <p>

      One of the tools for version control is git. I have found git to be relatively easy to learn, even though I know very little git, compared to other activities in my life. I have found that git allows me to work on something, say this blog, save it in the meantime and come back to it later. Once I add this to git and commit it for tracking I know it is safe until I come back. Git is also fun in the command line because I know I am changing the nature of my file when it changes the color of the text. For example, when I git status: my file shows green telling me to add it. Then when I add it or commit it the text will turn yellow. It's a little added sugar on top, I suppose. I'm sure I can change the color in bash to whatever I want, but at this point I'm not sure how. I will get back to you when I do know!.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next on the list is storing all of our new found information from git onto a remote site so we can access it anywhere, and that place is GitHub. GitHub has this massive community that can help you with a project/s. That's what it's there for! The open source community there is one of the largest if not the largest around. GitHub was, for some reason, really hard for me to grasp at first but working with it for a few days now and I'm learning its not too bad. I am still working on it and will learn it better, but until then I'm just having fun. GitHub is very user friendly, it has big green buttons so you know where to go if you're pulling or merging a request!  It's just a good place to store code because its quick to learn and the community there is awesome!!

      Well for now I must get ready for work so I will talk to you all again real soon!
