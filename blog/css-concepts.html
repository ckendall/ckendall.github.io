      Okay, here I am 3 weeks into DevBootcamps phase 0, I have been learning a ton and I have also been very tired. Since I work full-time I have to get up at 5 AM every morning to get a good start before I go to work and then do a couple more hours in after work. I do it to myself, though, because I also like to go outdoors and go cross-country skiing, rock climb and hang out with my wife. I try to fit it all in to my life because it is all worth it. When I am learning and have time for everything else in my life I know I'm doing something right. These last couple of weeks have been awesome! I have created my own, very first, website and even though it's really simple, I think its great. I have used concepts from CSS and HTML to get it done! I can't wait to keep learning more! 
      <p>
    <p>
      Now, on to what I have been learning these past couple of weeks - HTML and CSS. These two go hand-in-hand, kind of like peanut butter and jelly. HTML is the content that we see - paragraphs, home buttons, links to social media etc, and CSS is how we style those elements. When websites were first being desinged it was all in HTML, and at some point in time programers and designers finally came to realize that using HTML to design really sucked. that realization came to the creation of CSS. What CSS does is let the user create one set of styling rules that HTML has to follow. Without that the programmer would have to change every little detail in HTML. Think of it like this; HTML is like having 25 different toys laying on the ground and moving them one at a time, while CSS is like the box I can clump them all together and move them at once. Okay, maybe a bad metaphor, but I hope that gets the point across that CSS is a huge time saver.

      I want to share one concept that I have tried to understand over this last week. It has to do with CSS and how we display content on websites. Content can be displayed many different ways, some ways that I've learned are with margins, borders and padding. Lets start with margins, because I think they are the easiest to understand. Pretend we have a box on our screen with the word "easy" in it. Now, margin is how far that box is from the edge of the screen. If I want to move my box right I need to have a margin on the left so it pushes it right. It's a little counterintuitive, but if you think about it for a second it works. For border, pretend we have the boxes outline and its, lets say, red; that is the border. If we want to make the border larger we need to expand it by pixels like this - border: 2px;. this will make the border of our box larger and easier to see. Now for the padding - this moves our word "easy" around in the box. I can move it up, down, left, right all over the place, but it will always be in the box and our border. Think of these three elements as margin being the big picture, border is outlining the the content and padding is moving the content around inside that border.  
    <p>
    <p>
      I have learned quite a bit these last couple of weeks and I will continue to make my website and everything better. I am having so much fun doing all of this. I can actually see results from my fingers typing away. It's probably one of the most fun things I have learned. Well for now I will leave you with goodbye in another language, さようなら.
