 #What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that there is a hierarchy to these particular positioning elements. I will start with the largest which is margin – it creates a space between everything around it. Border – is a little more local to what the content has around it. Say there is a list; a border will create space between the individual pieces. The padding – this will create a little padding between the content and the border.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning is really hard to get right, especially since I have never done it before this challenge. I had no idea how to do it and I still don’t, really. It is fun to play around with and see what I can do. I never knew that it would be this hard and easy all at the same time to make a simple website.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest of the design is definitely the header and footer, for some reason I find these to be easy to format and make how I want. The most difficult is the body. This posses a real challenge for me because I just can’t quite grasp how to move everything in the body in relation to one another.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned a lot from this challenge, everything I know I learned from this challenge. I had zero experience with this, so formatting my own website using colors and moving pictures and headers and footers all of it was a delight to implement on something I could actually see.
