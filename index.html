			Hello Everyone, welcome to my very first website! I never thought that I would be able to code and I am very excited to bring this to you!

					<p>This was my first trip to Arches National Park in Utah. It is a beautiful place to travel to. Delicate arch is probably their most famaus arch, but there are so many others that will blow your mind, you just have to go look for them!</p>

					<p>Snow camping is one of my favorite things to do in the world. There's nothing like being out in the wilderness with a couple good friends sleeping and sharing a little bit of misery. I could stay out there for days and be perfectly content!</p>

					<p>This last picture is my very first 5.12 climb at Smith Rock State Park. It was extremely difficult, but super rewarding to be able to climb. There was some falling involved and that is okay. I enjoyed this climb a ton.</p>
